# 🧬 Genesis: Physics-Informed Stochastic MPC with Normalizing Flows

Genesis is a sophisticated machine learning project designed for Stochastic Model Predictive Control (S-MPC). It uses Conditional Normalizing Flows to model the uncertain dynamics of complex industrial systems (like Emerson SCADA pipelines).

Unlike standard regression models that predict a single instantaneous value, Genesis models the entire probability distribution of future states over a 4-hour trajectory. This allows operators to not only see what is likely to happen but also the risk (variance) associated with those predictions.

## 🏗 Architecture Overview

* **Core Model**: A Conditional RealNVP (Affine Coupling) architecture.
* **Physics-Informed Trajectories**: Ingests instantaneous sensor context ($x$) and control inputs ($u$) to predict Functional PCA coefficients representing a 4-hour future trajectory ($\theta$).
* **Hardware Optimized**: Built specifically for Apple Silicon (M4 Max/Ultra) using PyTorch `mps` (Metal Performance Shaders) for blazing-fast in-memory processing.

## 🛠 Setup & Installation

Follow these steps to get your environment ready for training and inference.

### 1. Environment Initialization

We use a dedicated virtual environment to handle specific dependency versions for Apple Silicon.

```bash
# Create and activate environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Upgrade pip and install requirements
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Weights & Biases (W&B) Dashboard

Genesis is deeply integrated with W&B for real-time training visualization, gradient tracking, and hardware monitoring.

```bash
wandb login
```

## 📊 Data Preparation (Crucial)

Before running the project, you must configure exactly which sensors and control variables you want to track. Because we predict 4-hour trajectories instead of instantaneous points, we use a Sliding Window + Functional PCA approach to compress SCADA curves into a few scalar numbers.

### 🧠 Feature Selection

The "Brain" of the model depends on which columns you choose. Open `src/data/preprocessing.py` and modify these three lists to match your specific SCADA export:

* `x_cols` (Context): Measured values you cannot control right now (e.g., Suction Pressure, Ambient Temp).
* `u_cols` (Controls): Variables you can change right now (e.g., Shaft Speed, Valve Positions).
* `theta_cols` (Targets): The variables you want the AI to predict the 4-hour future trajectory for (e.g., Discharge Pressure, Thermal Efficiency).

## 🚀 Running the Project

### Step 1: Preprocess the Data (Run Once)

> ⚠️ **You must run this step if it is your first time running the project, or if you have added a new raw SCADA dataset.**

This script reads your raw Parquet/Excel file, slices it into 4-hour sliding windows, performs Functional PCA compression on the target variables, and saves the optimized training file.

```bash
python src/data/preprocessing.py
```


### Step 1b: Explore Preprocessed Data (Optional but Recommended)

After running preprocessing, you can visually inspect everything that was produced using the exploration notebook.

## 📓 Notebooks

All notebooks live in the `notebooks/` directory. Open them in VS Code directly, or launch Jupyter:

```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/
```

### `explore_preprocessing.ipynb`

Visually inspect all artifacts produced by `src/data/preprocessing.py`. Run this after Step 1.

- **Part 1** — Shape and contents of `train / val / test` parquet splits
- **Part 2** — What the scalers learned (means, standard deviations, medians, IQRs per sensor)
- **Part 3** — How much variance each of the 12 PCA components captures (with charts)
- **Part 4** — How PCA coefficients evolve across time windows
- **Part 5** — Reconstructing a full 4-hour sensor trajectory from just 12 coefficients

> No data is uploaded anywhere — everything runs locally against your `data/processed/` and `outputs/checkpoints/` files.

### Step 2: Start Training

Execute the main training script. This will initialize the Normalizing Flow, start the Apple Silicon GPU-accelerated training loop, and log granular batch-level results to your Weights & Biases dashboard.

```bash
python scripts/train.py
```

### Step 3: Evaluate the Model

Once trained, run the evaluation script to sample 4-hour PCA trajectories from the flow and un-scale them to visualize how well the predicted probability distributions match the real SCADA physics.

```bash
python scripts/evaluate.py
```
